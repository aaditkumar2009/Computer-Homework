    <h2><center>The three national festival and their importance </center></h2>
</div>
  <p>India is a culturally diverse country. It is home to many religions, castes and communities. People celebrate many different festivals in the way the respective festivals are celebrated in their respective communities. But these national festival days have been immensely important in the chapters of Indian history. National festivals help bring in a sense of patriotism. It reminds us that despite all our differences, our love for our country unites us all. We commemorate these festivals with great pomp and show to celebrate the milestones of India’s history. National festivals in India constitute Independence Day, Republic Day and Gandhi Jayanti.

    Independence Day falls on the 15th of August. On this day, in 1947, the colonization of India by the British came to an end, which had lasted for two hundred years. It took a long drawn out struggle to free the country and its citizens from the shackles of British rule. The likes of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Sarojini Naidu and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, those who fought for our freedom are honored on this day. This day also marks the partition of India and Pakistan. To commemorate this day, first the President addresses the nation through a broadcast on the eve of 15th August. In the morning of the day, the present prime minister arrives at the Red Fort in New Delhi and the guard of honour greets him. The Indian national flag is hoisted and then the national anthem is sung across the nation. The prime minister addresses the nation from Red Fort, exactly the way Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, had done back in 1947. It is followed by a parade by the Indian military and paramilitary forces. Selected performances by school children are also carried out. Flag hoisting is done across India, majorly in schools and colleges. Every government building in the country sports the tri-color on its terrace. Kids and elders enjoy flying kites and playing with colors of our tri-color. Different plays and movies are showcased on various platforms, to remind the new generation of the contributions and sacrifices the freedom fighters made for us to be able to breathe in the free air.
    
    On 26th of January 1950, the Constitution of India came into effect and our country became a republic. On this day in the year 1929 the Indian National Congress had proclaimed “Poorna Swaraj” against the Dominion status offered by the British Regime. The final draft of the Constitution took two years and eleven months to be ready. It contained the preamble and fundamental rights that is guaranteed to each and every Indian citizen. The commemoration begins with the parade from RashtrapatiBhavan to Rajpath. Unlike Independence day, the President presides over the Republic Day celebration. The armed forces march towards the India Gate, the flag hoisting is done and the national anthem is sung. Armed forces and tableaus from various states, selected by the ministry of defense participate in the parade. Bravery awards are presented, the graves of those who sacrificed their lives for the country are garlanded- a leader from a foreign country is invited as a chief guest to honor the event. People wake up early on a Republic Day morning to watch the parade.
    
    To remember the Father of the Nation Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi also known as Mahatma Gandhi, his birth anniversary is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti. It falls on the 2nd October. He was one of the revered freedom fighters and is known for his ideologies of non-violence. His beliefs are still practiced. The Prime Minister pays homage at Raj Ghat, his crematorium. This day is observed in the schools too. Students take part in various events like essay competitions, poem recitation and banner-making promoting nonviolence. This day is also celebrated as the International day of Non-Violence in honor of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

    <h2><center>About Independence</center></h2>
</div>
  <p><br> Indian independence movement was a series of historic events with the ultimate aim of ending British rule in India. It lasted from 1857 to 1947.</br>

    The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking only the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more rights (economical in nature) for the people of the soil.<br> The early part of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards political self-rule proposed by leaders such as the Lal Bal Pal triumvirate, Aurobindo Ghosh and V. O. Chidambaram Pillai.</br>
    
    The last stages of the self-rule struggle from the 1920s were characterized by Congress's adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Nationalists like Subhas Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, and Bagha Jatin preached armed revolution to achieve self-rule. Poets and writers such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread political awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Pritilata Waddedar, and Begum Rokeya were just a few of the women of the Indian independence movement that promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in national politics.<br> B. R. Ambedkar championed the cause of disadvantaged sections of Indian society.</br> The peak of the campaigns by the Quit India Movement was during World War II led by Congress and the Indian National Army movement led by Subhas Chandra Bose with the help of Japan.
    
    <br> Indian independence movement encompassed all sections of society. It was in constant ideological evolution. Although the underlying ideology was anti-colonial, it was supported by a vision of independent capitalist economic development coupled with a secular, democratic, republican, and civil-libertarian political structure. After the 1930s, the movement took on a strong socialist orientation. The work of these various movements ultimately led to the Indian Independence Act 1947, which ended suzerainty in India, and created Pakistan.</br>
    
    India remained a Crown Dominion until 26 January 1950, when the Constitution of India came into force, establishing the Republic of India; Pakistan was a dominion until 1956 when it adopted its first republican constitution. In 1971, East Pakistan declared independence as the People's Republic of Bangladesh.</p>

    <h2><center>About Republic day</center></h2>
</div>
  <p>Republic Day is a national holiday in India, when the country marks and celebrates the date on which the Constitution of India came into effect on 26, January 1950, replacing the Government of India Act (1935) as the governing document of India and thus, turning the nation into a newly formed republic. The day also marks the transition of India from an autonomous Commonwealth realm with British Monarch as nominal head of the Indian Dominion, to a fully sovereign Commonwealth republic with the President of India as the nominal head of the Indian Union.

    The Constitution was adopted by the Indian Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system, completing the country's transition towards becoming an independent republic. 26 January was chosen as the date for Republic day because it was on this day in 1929 when the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress in lieu of the Realm status as a Dominion later instated by the departing British Regime.</p>
